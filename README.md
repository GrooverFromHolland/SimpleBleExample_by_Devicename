# Simple Universal Windows BleExample 
A well commented example using the advertisement watcher to select a device,
get the service and characteristic, show the most common  characteristic properties 
and subscibe to notification or indications.

There are no controls to keep it as simple as possible.
All the results are shown in the debug output window.
Added a stopwatch to time all the steps, like finding the device , get the service, connecting, get characteristic and subscribe to notifications or indications.

I am working on a new example that has some controls to list devices and their properties, send notify and receive possibilities.
